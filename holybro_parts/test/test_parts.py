Catalog self test: every part stands on its own.

The guarantee that EVERY catalog part is well formed lives here, next
to the parts. Each part runs
through the part_probe harness (four mounts: standalone, twin instances,
collision off, part on part), the result must satisfy urdfdom, and every
mesh it references must ship.
